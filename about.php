	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>
	As the production system is 3D printing and our designs for goods are provided by our sellers, anything within these constraints is fine to be sold. A stronger marketing influence will be had towards collectables and pop-culture items, as this has been identified as a strong market segment for both buyers and sellers. Marketing has a very strong influence on production scope, more so than usual, as the number of visitors to the website will directly relate to the production. With no pre-existing physical businesses, or the industry having a strong public image, it will be hard to gain any initial traction without a large number of users viewing the webpage on a daily basis.</p><p>
Sellers will design 3D models using CAD that will be readable by all the 3D printers in stock. Their designs must fit a set of specifications which will be clearly shown on the site, this will be to make sure no model is unable to be printed using the machines being used. A vetting system will also be implemented which will require uploads to be viewed and approved for sale, however to increase efficiency, sellers will be able to gain an Approved Seller status. This will both allow them to upload new content without undergoing the full vetting process and have an icon appear on their Profile and products showing them as of a good quality. Further marketing based tie-ins will be developed to bring in more sellers, causing both and increase in catalogue size and word of mouth. </p><p>
As statues and figurines will be common when dealing with pop culture fans, it will be important to allow the use of varying colours and materials. Costs will vary as different colours and materials are used in the models, a detailed list of additional costs in figure 2.2. </p><p>
Production will be undertaken by 3DSystems sPro 320 HS printing machine, this product was chosen as it prints in every current kind of material, quickly and allowing for wasted material to be re-used. This machine gives a capacity of 300 items per build, with each build taking 18 hours to complete. See Supply and Logistics section, for further details. </p><p>
Once the design has been turned into the final physical product, it is packed in the warehouse and shipped to the buyer. All shipping costs will be covered by the buyer.
